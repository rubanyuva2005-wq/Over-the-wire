# Bandit Level 25 → Level 26

## What I did
I escaped from a restricted shell by abusing how the terminal handles screen resizing.

## Commands I used
ssh bandit25@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
ls

## Result
I gained access to a usable shell for the next level.

## What I learned
- How restricted shells work
- Terminal behavior can be exploited
