# Bandit Level 23 → Level 24

## What I did
I created a script that was executed by a cron job to extract the password.

## Commands I used
echo "cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/password.txt" > script.sh
chmod +x script.sh

## Result
I got the password for Level 24.

## What I learned
- Writing basic shell scripts
- Leveraging cron job execution
